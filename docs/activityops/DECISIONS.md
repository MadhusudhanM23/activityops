# Decisions

Format: id, date, decision, rationale, spec anchor, reversibility.

## D-001 — 2026-10-07 — npm workspaces monorepo (`apps/api`, `apps/web`)
Lean single-deployable layout matching spec sec. 25 (Fastify + React + SQLite) and sec. 18 (one
Docker Compose stack). Reversible.

## D-002 — 2026-10-07 — Node built-in `node:sqlite`, WAL, single application writer
Spec sec. 18 requires WAL and one writer. A synchronous driver makes that discipline easy to
enforce and keeps state-transition tests deterministic.

`better-sqlite3` was the first choice and was **rejected after a real failure**: it has no prebuilt
binary for Node 24 on this machine and `node-gyp` could not find a Visual Studio installation, so
`npm install` failed. `node:sqlite` is synchronous, needs no native toolchain, and keeps the
deployment image simple. Verified: `PRAGMA journal_mode` returns `wal`.

Consequence: the runtime floor is Node 22+ (Node 24 in CI and in the container image). Reversible
before Phase 2 ends if a driver feature turns out to be missing.

## D-003 — 2026-10-07 — Timing values are configuration, not constants
`CLOCK_SKEW_ALLOWANCE_SECONDS=30`, `SESSION_WINDOW_SECONDS=600`,
`DEMO_SESSION_WINDOW_SECONDS=300`, `POST_WINDOW_OBSERVATION_MARGIN_SECONDS=60` ship as defaults so
T5 can tighten them with measured evidence (spec sec. 8.2-8.4, 9.4). The 120-second pre-window is
explicitly forbidden.

## D-004 — 2026-10-07 — No product UI before the Day-1 gate
Spec sec. 21 and 34. The Phase 0 web app is a deliberate placeholder.

## D-005 — 2026-10-07 — Bedrock model id stays unset in `.env.example`
Spec sec. 17: "Do not assume Claude is available." T9 establishes region and model id against the
real account before any agent code is written.

## D-006 — 2026-10-07 — CodeRabbit configured with spec-derived path instructions
`.coderabbit.yaml` encodes the evidence-honesty and state-machine rules as review instructions so
spec drift is caught at review time rather than at demo time. `request_changes_workflow: true`.
Requires a GitHub remote to take effect (B-004).
